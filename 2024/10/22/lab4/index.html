<p>The principle I understand should be that 5G technology is more frequent, because I only use 5G communication in daily life, so I know less about other detailed principles.</p>
<p>Q2. What are the main aspects of your use of 5G services?</p>
<p>I mainly use the software to download files using the 5G network and watching HD videos.</p>
<p>Q3. How was your experience with 5G?</p>
<p>I experienced that the 5G network was fast, with low latency, and a more stable connection.</p>
<p>Q4. What industries do you think 5G can drive?</p>
<p>I think the reliability and low latency of 5G provide better support for industrial automation. With 5G networks, factory equipment, robots, and sensors can communicate and collaborate efficiently, increasing productivity and flexibility.</p>
<p>Q5. Although 5G performance is higher, the price of 5G is also higher than that of 4G, what do you think about this?</p>
<p>I think 5G is more cost-effective, and it may be that with the development of technology and the popularization of applications, the price of 5G will gradually stabilize, and may gradually be close to or even the same as the price of 4G, because when 4G was first developed, it also faced this problem.</p>

<h3 id="Main-Body-3"><a href="#Main-Body-3" class="headerlink" title="-Main Body-"></a>-Main Body-</h3><h4 id="Topic-1：-Highway-traffic-is-restricted"><a href="#Topic-1：-Highway-traffic-is-restricted" class="headerlink" title="Topic 1： Highway traffic is restricted"></a>Topic 1： Highway traffic is restricted</h4><p>Q1.What is your opinion on highway restrictions?</p>
<p>Due to traffic restrictions, we cannot enter the highway for certain periods of time, which makes us need to choose a detour road or adjust the driving plan, which brings some inconvenience to our work.</p>
<p>Q2. Has the restriction affected your income?</p>
<p>The restrictions have had an impact on my income. Due to traffic restrictions, I can’t use the highway to shorten travel times during rush hour, and detours can be longer or congested, resulting in more time spent on the road, impacting the number of orders I complete and resulting in less revenue.</p>
<p>Q3. How would you choose a detour route during the traffic restriction period?</p>
<p>During traffic restrictions, I use the intelligent navigation system to get real-time traffic information and choose the fastest detour route based on its recommendations. Sometimes the detour route is also affected by congestion, so it is necessary to make a judgment based on experience.</p>
<p>Q4. Do you think highway restrictions help traffic flow and road congestion?</p>
<p>I think it helps to reduce traffic flow during rush hour and improve the efficiency of the road by restricting some vehicles from entering the highway. However, traffic restrictions can also lead to congestion on detour routes, especially during traffic restrictions, when other roads may carry more traffic, so proper traffic management and planning are required to balance.</p>
<p>Q5. Do you think you should continue to restrict highways?</p>
<p>I think highway traffic restrictions are effective for traffic management and road congestion to a certain extent. However, I believe that when implementing traffic restrictions, it is necessary to take into account various factors, including traffic conditions, urban planning and public travel needs. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the construction of public transport, improve the convenience and coverage of public transport, and provide citizens with more choices to reduce the use and dependence of private cars.</p>
<h4 id="Topic2：-Scenic-Restrictions"><a href="#Topic2：-Scenic-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Topic2： Scenic Restrictions"></a>Topic2： Scenic Restrictions</h4><p>Q1. What are your thoughts on the recent new regulations on traffic restrictions in scenic spots?</p>
<p>The restriction of traffic in scenic areas has some impact on us taxi drivers. First of all, the restriction of traffic in the scenic area means that we cannot enter the scenic area to pick up customers at any time, which may reduce our potential revenue. Secondly, restricting the entry of private cars into the scenic area may lead to tourists choosing to take public transportation, which will also reduce our number of passengers and income.</p>
<p>Q2. So, what do you think is the impact of the restriction on the tourism industry?</p>
<p>Restrictions on travel in scenic areas may reduce tourists’ willingness to visit scenic spots, especially those traveling by car. If they can’t drive directly into the scenic area, they may choose a different destination or change their travel plans. This may have a certain impact on the businesses and tourism economy around the scenic spot.</p>
<p>Q3. Do you think the scenic area traffic restriction measures are necessary?</p>
<p>I understand that the original intention of the restriction is to reduce traffic pressure, protect the environment and improve the visitor experience. Although there are some inconveniences for us taxi drivers, such measures are necessary if we can better manage the traffic in the scenic area and improve the travel efficiency and comfort of tourists.</p>
<p>Q4. Do you think the restriction of scenic spots should be popularized throughout the country?</p>
<p>I believe that this policy should be applied to reasonable places according to the actual situation of each city, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Q5. What advice do you have for the government to alleviate the impact of the restriction on taxi drivers?</p>
<p>The government can consider making a reasonable travel plan to ensure that taxi drivers still have the opportunity to participate in scenic pick-up and drop-off services, such as setting up some dedicated taxi parking spots or opening up certain time slots for taxis to enter. In addition, the government can also increase investment in public transportation, improve the capacity and convenience of public transportation, and encourage more tourists to choose to take public transportation to scenic spots.</p>
<h4 id="Topic3：-Fuel-Vehicle-Restrictions"><a href="#Topic3：-Fuel-Vehicle-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Topic3： Fuel Vehicle Restrictions"></a>Topic3： Fuel Vehicle Restrictions</h4><p>Q1. Is the taxi you using a gasoline car or an electric energy car?</p>
<p>I’m using an electric energy car.</p>
<p>Q2. How does the recent city implementation of the fuel vehicle restriction policy affect you as a taxi driver using fuel vehicles?</p>
<p>The policy of restricting the driving of fuel vehicles has indeed caused some problems for us taxi drivers. We may need to buy or rent new energy vehicles, and the value of our fuel vehicles in the market has decreased, resulting in a certain loss of our costs.</p>
<p>Q3. What do you think is the purpose of the fuel vehicle restriction policy?</p>
<p>I believe that the original intention of the policy is to reduce environmental pollution and improve air quality. Restricting the passage of fuel vehicles can reduce exhaust emissions and reduce the degree of environmental pollution.</p>
<p>Q4. What other measures do you think the government can take under the policy of restricting the driving of fuel vehicles?</p>
<p>The government could consider providing more support and incentives to help taxi drivers gradually transition to more environmentally friendly vehicles. For example, subsidies or loan programs can be offered to encourage taxi drivers to switch to electric vehicles or other low-emission vehicles. The government can also increase investment in the construction of charging infrastructure to ensure the convenience of charging electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Q5. Under the policy of restricting the driving of fuel vehicles, what do you think citizens should take?</p>
<p>Citizens should support the government in pursuing such policies, actively participate in environmental protection actions, and contribute to the common environment, protecting the environment is protecting our future, and citizens should choose more environmentally friendly means of transportation as much as possible when they appear.</p>
